Dialogue: 0,1:31:50.01,1:31:58.45,NanohaW Subaru,,0,0,0,,Not just this. When Ms. Presea tells Fate\Nto be like Alicia and act a little more selfish,

Dialogue: 0,1:33:53.01,1:33:59.11,NanohaW Subaru,,0,0,0,,Uh... the light blue and sky blue of Alicia's and\Nmy magic means we're positive and optimistic.
Dialogue: 0,1:33:59.11,1:34:02.49,NanohaW Vivio,,0,0,0,,Eh? But I think Enforcer Chrono's magic\Nis also that sort of blue.

Dialogue: 0,1:34:06.26,1:34:09.79,NanohaW Teana,,0,0,0,,Hmm... really? What does that say about him then?
Dialogue: 0,1:34:09.79,1:34:12.03,NanohaW Subaru,,0,0,0,,Blue means serious and straight-laced.
Dialogue: 0,1:34:12.03,1:34:14.63,NanohaW Teana,,0,0,0,,That seems right.\NIsn't Ginga blue as well?
Dialogue: 0,1:34:14.63,1:34:18.97,NanohaW Subaru,,0,0,0,,Ginny has more of an indigo color,\Nso between blue and purple, I guess.

Dialogue: 0,1:34:54.01,1:34:58.01,NanohaW Teana,,0,0,0,,Oh, Caro and Fate look like they're enjoying this.
Dialogue: 0,1:34:58.01,1:35:06.04,NanohaW Subaru,,0,0,0,,Fate's golden color is quite rare so I'm not really sure,\Nbut yellow is kind and well-mannered.

Dialogue: 0,1:35:21.38,1:35:24.97,NanohaW Subaru,,0,0,0,,Ah, right, right!\NNanoha and Caro are virtuous and focused!
Dialogue: 0,1:35:24.97,1:35:30.32,NanohaW Teana,,0,0,0,,Nanoha's color is a little more red,\Nso would she also be passionate and straightforward?
Dialogue: 0,1:35:31.13,1:35:32.54,NanohaW Subaru,,0,0,0,,It's right on!
Dialogue: 0,1:35:32.54,1:35:34.97,NanohaW Vivio,,0,0,0,,Then what about Tia and Arf's orange color?
Dialogue: 0,1:35:34.97,1:35:39.24,NanohaW Subaru,,0,0,0,,Um... empathetic and deeply emotional.
Dialogue: 0,1:35:40.14,1:35:42.84,NanohaW Teana,,0,0,0,,That might be right for Arf,\Nbut it's a bit off for me.

Dialogue: 0,1:35:45.32,1:35:50.83,NanohaW Subaru,,0,0,0,,And it's a mix of red and yellow so you're kind and\Npassionate and come off as a bit of an angry person.
Dialogue: 0,1:35:50.83,1:35:53.61,NanohaW Teana,,0,0,0,,Right, you're just bending the rules however you want.

Dialogue: 0,1:36:24.62,1:36:32.35,NanohaW Caro,,0,0,0,,It seems that white means talented at leading\Nwhile being a little clumsy, and green is compassionate.

Dialogue: 0,1:36:50.92,1:36:55.31,NanohaW Caro,,0,0,0,,By this point, she's already identifying as "Fate".
Dialogue: 0,1:36:55.31,1:37:01.04,NanohaW Erio,,0,0,0,,I think this is after Presea edited the memories\Nthat were transferred into Fate.
Dialogue: 0,1:37:01.04,1:37:04.80,NanohaW Caro,,0,0,0,,I see. So that's why she was in a place\Nthat looked like a hospital room.
