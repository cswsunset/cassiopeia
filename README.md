Scripts for Cassiopeia Subtitle Works releases

*Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha* scripts are derived from the Geneon/Mctopee/Adhiesc lineage. The specific scripts we use as a base come from the Adhiesc releases, with the OP and ED stitched back into the rest of the script. The same goes for *Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's*.

The main *Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha the Movie 1st* script is derived from Commie's release, which is in turn based on the Blu-ray subs. The commentary script is derived from the Ron/Autism release.
